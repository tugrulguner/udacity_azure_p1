# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

## Summary

This dataset contains bankmarketing data, where target is whether the client subscribed a term deposit or not, 'yes' or 'no'. Using the features provided in the dataset, aim of this project to find the best parameters using HyperDriveConfig and AutoML.

Best model is found as Voting by AutoML mode with >95% accuracy. 

## Scikit-learn Pipeline
Data is imported using by using TabularDataFactory from the given dataset url, and then processed as preprocessing through the clean_data function in train.py script. Then, it split it into train and test and then model creation followed by score calculation. All of these steps are coded in train.py script, which is used by by ScriptRunConfig together with args necessary for the script. This configuration is fed into HyperDriveConfig together with RandomParameterSampling on args, Bandit policy, primary metric and primary metric goal. Then this system submitted to the cluster.

**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**
I used RandomSampling because it is fast and results in almost equal accuracies compared to Grid one.

**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**


## AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**

## Pipeline comparison
**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**

## Future work
**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**
